                Before discussing the current version of myself, let me first explain how the previous version of myself came to be. a quick story is below!
                
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                When I was younger, I had a lot of computer-related inquiries! I pondered every time I played games or searched the internet. How such a tiny device is able to produce such miracles! I'm constantly baffled as to how I manage to play games, watch videos, search the internet, etc.
                When something puzzles me or I don't understand it, I always want to learn everything there is to know about it. and for that reason, I started using my computer and phone more frequently.
                 I always pick up my computer the moment I have some free time on the weekend or after school, even if I have nothing to do!
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I have vivid memories of watching several Hollywood films as a young child that dealt with technology and hacking, including V for Vendetta, Who Am I, The Social Network, etc. I can still picture a man sitting at a desk wearing a black mask, inputting programmes into a green and black themed editor, and successfully doing astonishing feats.

                I grew more conscious of technology's possibilities and was amazed by the most recent breakthroughs. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                It's for this reason that I choose to major in computer science and engineering. I wanted to be updated and keep learning more and more about cutting-edge technology. I always aspire to be someone who is constantly learning about the things that intrigue him, just like I did when I was a child.
