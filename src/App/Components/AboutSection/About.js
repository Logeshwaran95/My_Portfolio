                Once upon a time, in a world of pixels and possibilities, a young tech enthusiast embarked on an epic quest for knowledge and coding adventures. üíª‚ú®
                <br></br>

Armed with curiosity and a thirst for digital marvels, I couldn't help but wonder: How do these tiny devices conjure such magical wonders? From playing games to surfing the internet, the tech realm never ceased to amaze me. I dived headfirst into the digital rabbit hole, determined to unravel its mysteries. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîç
<br></br>
As I grew older, Hollywood films like V for Vendetta, Who Am I, and The Social Network further fueled my tech fascination. I couldn't resist envisioning myself as a masked coding genius, typing away at glowing screens and accomplishing astonishing feats. It was then that I knew - the world of technology had me under its spell. üé¨üöÄ

              <br></br>
              As I journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I continue to specialize in building awesome websites and mobile applications. My go-to languages for problem-solving are C++ and Java. When it comes to web development, I'm well-versed in the MERN stack. And for cross-platform mobile development, I've got a knack for React Native. But wait, there's more! I also have a growing interest in machine learning. While I'm still exploring the depths of this fascinating field, I'm eager to dive deeper and uncover the endless possibilities it holds.
<br></br>
When I'm not engrossed in coding, you might catch me unleashing my competitive spirit in PC games or indulging in a friendly game of football. So, let's connect and bring some coding magic to life!
<br></br>
Keep calm and code on!
